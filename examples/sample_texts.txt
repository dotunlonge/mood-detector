I told him to deploy the backend yesterday but he said 'lol okay' and disappeared.

I'm too tired to deal with this API today.

This is amazing! I love it so much!

Why does everything break when I try to deploy? What is the meaning of life?

Bruh, we ball. Let's go!

I'm so stressed and exhausted. Everything is on fire.

Whatever, I don't care anymore. Meh.

WTF is happening? Seriously, this is confusing.

Perfect! This is exactly what I needed. You're brilliant!

I need sleep. I'm burned out. Everything is chaos.
